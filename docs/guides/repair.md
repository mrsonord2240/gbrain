# Repair residual damage with `gbrain repair`

`gbrain doctor` finds some damage that it cannot fix on its own: timeline
history that exists only in the database, derived pages without an explicit
visibility, and pages indexed before the safe-chunk fence. `gbrain repair`
fixes those three kinds. Every run is a preview unless you pass `--apply`.

**Say to your agent:** *"Doctor says some timeline history is only in the
database. Show me what `gbrain repair` would change, then apply it."* The
agent runs `gbrain repair` to preview and, after you agree,
`gbrain repair <kind> --apply` on the brain host.

## Preview first

```bash
gbrain repair                    # preview every kind
gbrain repair timeline           # preview one kind
gbrain repair --json             # machine-readable preview
```

The preview names the brain and sources it will touch, then prints one block
per kind:

```text
Scope: brain <brain id>; sources default
timeline: 12 item(s) to repair
  e.g. default:people/alice-example, default:companies/acme-example
  materializable_rows=31, kept_unrenderable_rows=2
  cost: 12 request ID(s), 196608 receipt bytes, 12 page(s) to re-embed
  capacity brain lifetime_ids: 4100 of 1000000 (stops at 900000)
  ...
  apply: gbrain repair timeline --apply
```

- **Items** are pages. The sample lists at most 10 of them as `source:slug`.
- **Residuals** are named counters: some count what the repair will do
  (`materializable_rows`, `atoms_origin_gone_to_private`), others count rows
  it leaves alone (see [What each kind fixes](#what-each-kind-fixes)).
- **Cost** is what an apply of the pending items would consume: one permanent
  request ID and 16 KiB of reserved receipt space per page for `timeline` and
  `visibility`, and nothing for `safe-chunks`. When an embedding model is
  configured and priced, the line adds an estimated embedding cost in dollars.
- **Capacity** shows the write-journal counters the run draws on and the 90%
  line where it stops (see [Capacity stop](#capacity-stop)).
- **apply** is the command that applies this kind with the same `--source`
  (and `--no-embed`). It does not repeat `--limit`; add it yourself if you
  previewed a limited batch.

## Apply

```bash
gbrain repair timeline --apply
gbrain repair visibility --apply
gbrain repair safe-chunks --apply
gbrain repair safe-chunks --apply --no-embed   # re-seal text now, embed later
gbrain repair --all --apply                    # every kind in order
```

`--apply` writes without a prompt, so review the preview first. With
`--apply` you must name a kind or pass `--all`; `--yes` is refused. `--all`
runs `timeline`, then `visibility`, then `safe-chunks`, and stops at the
first kind that stops.

Each item is re-checked against the page's current state just before it is
written, and the write is bound to the revision it just read, so an edit made
after planning is kept and repaired too. An item that no longer needs the
repair, or whose page changes during the write, is counted as `skipped` and
left for the next run. Nothing is deleted.

| Option | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--apply` | Write the repair. Without it, only preview. |
| `--source <id>` | Limit the run to one active source. The default is every active (non-archived) source. An unknown or archived id is refused. |
| `--limit <n>` | Repair at most `n` items per kind in this run (a positive integer; with `--all`, up to `n` for each of the three kinds). Rerun the same command to continue. |
| `--no-embed` | `safe-chunks` only: re-seal chunk text and skip embedding. Run `gbrain embed --stale` later. |
| `--all` | Run every kind in order. |
| `--json` | Print `{ scope, mode, results[] }`, one result per kind with `affected`, `sample`, `residuals`, `cost`, `capacity`, `resumed_from`, `applied`, `skipped`, `complete`, `stopped` and `apply_command`. |

The command exits 1 when a run stops early (capacity, a pending write, or a
held writer). A `--limit` batch that leaves work behind exits 0, so scripts
should also check `results[].complete`.

## What each kind fixes

| Kind | Doctor check that points here | What it does | Left alone and counted |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `timeline` | `timeline_history` | Re-saves each page with its current body through a revision-bound `put_page`. The save writes each database-only timeline entry back into the page as a bullet preceded by `<!-- gbrain:materialized v1 <hash> -->`. | `kept_unrenderable_rows`: entries that would change if written as a bullet (for example an empty source). They stay in the database. |
| `visibility` | `derived_visibility` | Stamps an explicit `visibility` on extracted atoms and synthesized concepts. An atom takes its origin page's visibility; transcript atoms and atoms whose origin is gone become `private`; a concept takes the strictest visibility of its input atoms. A concept input found only through an atom's `concepts:` list counts as private. Atoms are repaired before concepts. It never loosens an explicit value: `private` stays `private`, and `world` can only become `private`. A missing value is stamped with the origin's value, which is `world` when the origin page is public. | `concepts_without_lineage`: concepts whose inputs cannot be found. They stay as they are, and remote readers already treat a missing visibility as private. `atoms_origin_gone_to_private` counts atoms made private because their origin page no longer exists. |
| `safe-chunks` | `contextual_retrieval_coverage` (`details.unsealed_pages`) | Rebuilds the chunks of markdown and code pages indexed before the safe-chunk fence, which remote and MCP search withhold. It rebuilds projections only: no page write, no new page version and no request ID. Vectors whose embedding input did not change are kept; the rest are embedded unless you pass `--no-embed` or no embedding model is configured. | `code_without_source_path`: code pages with no recorded file to re-chunk. `unsupported_page_kind`: other page kinds, such as images. Their importer re-seals them. |

Timeline rows that an earlier version of a page produced and its current text
no longer has are removals, not history, so `timeline` neither counts nor
restores them. Doctor reports those as `timeline_orphans`; preview their
removal with `gbrain extract timeline --prune-orphans --dry-run`, then run it
without `--dry-run`.

A timeline repair can make pages gain marked bullets. That is the fix: the
history is now visible in the page and survives later edits. Deleting a marked
bullet in a save that passes the current `expected_revision` deletes its entry.

## Resume

Runs are resumable. After each page commits, the position is saved under the
kind, the brain and the source list. Rerunning the same command (the same kind
and `--source`) continues after the last committed page, and the preview says
`resuming after item ...`. A finished run clears the saved position. `--limit`
does not change the position key, so `--limit 500` batches continue each other.

Request IDs are derived from the page and its revision, so rerunning after a
crash replays the same write instead of making a second one. If the run stops
with "still pending publication" or "the canonical writer ... is held", check
`gbrain sources writer status <source>`, then rerun the printed apply command.

## Capacity stop

`timeline` and `visibility` write through the managed write journal, which has
permanent per-principal and per-brain limits on request IDs and receipt bytes.
Before each page, the repair checks those counters and stops before it would
cross 90% of any limit. The stop message names the setting and a value that
lets the remaining pages finish:

```text
STOPPED: Stopped before crossing 90% of brain lifetime_ids (...). Run: gbrain config set persistence.limits.brain_lifetime_ids 1200000 — then rerun `gbrain repair timeline --apply` to resume.
```

Raise the limit on the brain host only if you agree, then rerun. Raised limits
are brain-wide; request IDs stay permanent replay protection. `safe-chunks`
takes no journal admission and never hits this stop. The limits and their
defaults are in [bounded admission and retention](concurrent-writes.md#bounded-admission-and-retention).

## Where it runs

Run `gbrain repair` on the brain host, the machine that holds the database. A
thin client refuses before doing anything:

```text
`gbrain repair` is not routable. repair runs on the brain host (it publishes coordinated page writes against the local engine). Run `gbrain repair` on the brain host.
```

A repair is an ordinary trusted local write and follows the same rules as
any other page save. It never transfers an existing owner and does not change
activation, sync checkpoints or search settings. Like any local save on a
PGLite brain, the first `timeline` or `visibility` write to a source with a
configured checkout and no owner yet claims that checkout for this host. Do not set
`search.remote_private_pages` to get derived pages back remotely: that exposes
every private page.

## Verify

```bash
gbrain repair --json     # every kind reports "affected": 0
gbrain doctor --json     # timeline_history, derived_visibility, unsealed_pages
```

Items the repair leaves alone can keep a doctor warning: concepts without
lineage still count under `derived_visibility`, and code pages without a
source path or unsupported page kinds still count as unsealed pages. Check
the residual counters before treating a remaining warning as a failed repair.
